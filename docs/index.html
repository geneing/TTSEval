    <h1>TTS Comparison</h1>

<p> This is a small test of a few popular recent TTS models. I wanted to see how good these systems are for generating audiobooks.</p>
<p>I used default weights and parameters. Code is <a href="https://github.com/geneing/TTSEval">here</a></p>
<p>I provided kokoro sample to the other three models as input for zero-shot cloning. I'm not testing voice cloning, but it's easier to compare output when voice is similar for the samples.</p>

        <p><h3>Testing for alignment issues on a text with repeated word patterns.</h3></p>
        Notice that fish-speech skips some words in the middle, which is a common problem when using LLM based TTS. Chatterbox has a strange noise at the end of the audio, which is also a common problem with LLM based TTS. Mega_tts3 makes an unnatural pause before "then".

        The shells she sells are seashells, I’m sure, so if she sells seashells on the seashore, then I’m sure she sells seashore shells.

        <h2>Test 2. Reading paragraph-long text with long sentences.</h2>
        <p><h3>Testing reading of long sentences. Looking for consistent prosody and style.<br>Would you like to listen to a full audiobook that sounds like this?</h3></p>
        <p><h3>Text (from "The Engineer's Thumb" by Arthur Conan Doyle)</h3></p>
        <p>
        Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice—that of Mr. Hatherley’s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton’s madness.<br>
        Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results.<br>
        The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth.<br>
        At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect.<br>
        It was in the summer of ’89, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to summarise.<br>
        I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us.<br>
        My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from among the officials.<br>
        One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.<br>
        One morning, at a little before seven o’clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room.<br>
        I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs.<br>
        As I descended, my old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.<br>
        "I’ve got him here," he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; "he’s all right."<br>
        "What is it, then?"<br>
        I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.<br>
        "It’s a new patient," he whispered.<br>
        "I thought I’d bring him round myself; then he couldn’t slip away.<br>
        There he is, all safe and sound.<br>
        I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you."<br>
        And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.

        <h2>Test 3. Emotive reading. </h2>
        <p><h3>Testing on an emotive text. Does the TTS render emotions well?</h3></p>
        In principle, all four TTS systems should be able to read this text with the right intonation and emotion. 
        Does it have the right balance of emotion, clarity, and expressiveness for reading audiobooks? 
        Too much emotion can make it sound unnatural, while too little can make it sound flat.

        The old photograph, its edges softened by time, trembled in her hand.<br>
        A faint smile touched her lips as she traced the face of the young man in the picture – a face so vibrant, so full of dreams, now just a whisper from the past.<br>
        A tear, hot and unexpected, betrayed the carefully constructed composure she wore, blurring the image even further.<br>
        She remembered the warmth of his laughter, the comforting strength of his embrace, and a wave of profound sorrow washed over her, mingled with a bittersweet gratitude for the love they had shared.<br>
        The silence in the room grew heavy, a testament to the years that had passed, and the aching void he had left behind.<br>
        The old wooden gate creaked open, a sound I hadn't heard in years, and suddenly, I was a child again, bathed in the hazy afternoon sun.<br>
        A wave of something warm and bittersweet washed over me – the ghost of laughter, the phantom scent of my grandmother's roses, the aching hollowness of a time that was, and could never be again.<br>
        For a moment, just a breathtaking, heart-stopping moment, everything was perfect, whole, unbroken.<br>
        Then, the wind shifted, the illusion shattered, and I was left standing alone, the weight of all the intervening years pressing down, a single tear tracing a path through the dust on my cheek.<br>
        What do you mean, "it's just gone"?<br>
        Gone where?<br>
        You stood right there, you promised me it would be safe!<br>
        I trusted you!<br>
        And now… now you're just shrugging?<br>
        Like it's a misplaced set of keys and not the one thing, the only thing, I had left?<br>
        I don't understand.<br>
        How could you be so careless?<br>
        Or… or was it something else?<br>
        Tell me!<br>
        Look at me and tell me what really happened, because this… this makes no sense!<br>
        The moment I saw her face in the crowd, a grin stretched so wide across my own I thought it might actually stay that way forever.<br>
        Years, it had been years!<br>
        And yet, there she was, waving, her laughter already reaching me like the brightest melody.<br>
        Suddenly, all the weariness of the journey, all the little anxieties that had been nibbling at me, just vanished, poof!<br>
        Replaced by this bubbling, infectious joy that made me want to leap and spin and shout to the whole world.<br>
        Everything felt lighter, brighter, like the sun had decided to shine just for us in that perfect, unforgettable second.<br>

        This tests TTS model's ability to guess pronunciation for words that were not in the training set. There's no ground truth here - it's English after all - but it shouldn't sound completely wrong either.

        <h4>The Chronovore's Lament</h4><br>
        <br>
        Elara, a pale, almost phosphorescent being, clutched her aetheric kamira, its multifaceted quasifracto humming with latent temporal energy.<br>
        She peered into the swirling vortex of the chronovore's maw, a nauseating confluence of displaced xenos and noumena.<br>
        "It's a complete zugzwang," she murmured, her voice a low, guttural rasp, "This hypergolic implosion will omnifract the entire Veridia nexus, creating a pan-schism of unimaginable kakistocracy."<br>
        Her companion, a wizened Glyptodon named Xylos, grunted his agreement, adjusting the neuro-oscillator strapped to his cranium.<br>
        "Indeed, Elara."<br>
        The gnostic algorithms indicate a thaumaturgical convergence of phantasmagoria and a complete subsumption of ontological parameters.<br>
        We must recalibrate the transmogrifier before the abyssal skiamachy commences.<br>
