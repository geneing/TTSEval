The old photograph, its edges softened by time, trembled in her hand.
A faint smile touched her lips as she traced the face of the young man in the picture – a face so vibrant, so full of dreams, now just a whisper from the past.
A tear, hot and unexpected, betrayed the carefully constructed composure she wore, blurring the image even further.
She remembered the warmth of his laughter, the comforting strength of his embrace, and a wave of profound sorrow washed over her, mingled with a bittersweet gratitude for the love they had shared.
The silence in the room grew heavy, a testament to the years that had passed, and the aching void he had left behind.
The old wooden gate creaked open, a sound I hadn't heard in years, and suddenly, I was a child again, bathed in the hazy afternoon sun.
A wave of something warm and bittersweet washed over me – the ghost of laughter, the phantom scent of my grandmother's roses, the aching hollowness of a time that was, and could never be again.
For a moment, just a breathtaking, heart-stopping moment, everything was perfect, whole, unbroken.
Then, the wind shifted, the illusion shattered, and I was left standing alone, the weight of all the intervening years pressing down, a single tear tracing a path through the dust on my cheek.
What do you mean, "it's just gone"?
Gone where?
You stood right there, you promised me it would be safe!
I trusted you!
And now… now you're just shrugging?
Like it's a misplaced set of keys and not the one thing, the only thing, I had left?
I don't understand.
How could you be so careless?
Or… or was it something else?
Tell me!
Look at me and tell me what really happened, because this… this makes no sense!
The moment I saw her face in the crowd, a grin stretched so wide across my own I thought it might actually stay that way forever.
Years, it had been years!
And yet, there she was, waving, her laughter already reaching me like the brightest melody.
Suddenly, all the weariness of the journey, all the little anxieties that had been nibbling at me, just vanished, poof!
Replaced by this bubbling, infectious joy that made me want to leap and spin and shout to the whole world.
Everything felt lighter, brighter, like the sun had decided to shine just for us in that perfect, unforgettable second.
