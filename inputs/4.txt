The Chronovore's Lament

Elara, a pale, almost phosphorescent being, clutched her aetheric kamira, its multifaceted quasifracto humming with latent temporal energy.
She peered into the swirling vortex of the chronovore's maw, a nauseating confluence of displaced xenos and noumena.
"It's a complete zugzwang," she murmured, her voice a low, guttural rasp, "This hypergolic implosion will omnifract the entire Veridia nexus, creating a pan-schism of unimaginable kakistocracy."
Her companion, a wizened Glyptodon named Xylos, grunted his agreement, adjusting the neuro-oscillator strapped to his cranium.
"Indeed, Elara."
The gnostic algorithms indicate a thaumaturgical convergence of phantasmagoria and a complete subsumption of ontological parameters.
We must recalibrate the transmogrifier before the abyssal skiamachy commences.
